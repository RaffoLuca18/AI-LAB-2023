Hypoxia, a condition characterized by inadequate oxygen supply to tissues, plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to hypoxia is essential for advancing knowledge of these processes and potentially developing targeted therapeutic interventions. In this project, we present a gene-activity-based classification approach to solve the hypoxia puzzle in scRNA-seq data. By integrating gene expression profiles and prior knowledge of hypoxia-related genes, we aim to accurately identify and characterize cells in different oxygenation states.

The primary goal of this notebook is to investigate cell classification based on gene activity, with a specific emphasis on distinguishing cells in normoxic and hypoxic states. This report aims to uncover discernible patterns and informative markers that can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of cellular states. Furthermore, a dedicated section of the report focuses on feature selection, elucidating the crucial variables that significantly contribute to accurate classification and predictive modeling within this specific context.
